# Deep-Learning Traffic Sign Classifier
---

I built this traffic sign classifier as an assignment for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program in June 2017.
(https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013)

Udacity provided the data which was already labeled, serialized and split into train, test, and cross-validation sets.

This classifier is written in Python3 and uses the tensorflow library.

All code is organised in the jupyter notebook `Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb` examining other files in this repository is not necessary for understanding this project.

Code blocks are interspersed among markdown cells which explain what different parts of the code are doing.
